# OBSOLETE - USE FORK OF CVELIST REPO

Please fork https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/cvelist

See https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/cvelist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.

## Previous data:

This repo contains subdirectories in the form YEAR (e.g. 2017, 2016), the year directories contain prefix directories such as 1000xxx, 1001xxx and so on, each prefix sub directory contains up to 1000 CVE's starting with the directory specified prefix.

If a subdirectory becomes to large it can be sharded off, if this happens a note will be left in the sub directory to point at the new repo for this.

This directory format is now compatible with the MITRE cvelist repo. 

Please note that some of the data from 2015 and 2016 needs to be brought up to date to the current JSON v.4 format, if you'd like to do this please do so and submit a pull request.
